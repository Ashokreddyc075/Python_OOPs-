By using Composition(IS - A) Relationship:
=========================================
In Python, the IS-A relationship is a way of representing inheritance between classes. It is also known as a class inheritance relationship. 
The IS-A relationship is used to create a new class that is a modified version of an existing class.



EX:
==
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        
    def eat(self):
        print("The animal is eating.")

class Dog(Animal):
    def bark(self):
        print("The dog is barking.")

class Cat(Animal):
    def meow(self):
        print("The cat is meowing.")

#a = Animal("Dog",21)
#a.eat()

d = Dog("Dog",21)
d.bark()

EX:
==
class Person:
    def __init__(self,name,age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    def eat_drink(self):
        print("Eat Birytani and drink water")
        
class Emp(Person):
    def __init__(self,name,age,eno,esal):
        super().__init__(name,age)
        self.eno = eno
        self.esal = esal
    def work(self):
        print("Coding python")
    
    def EmpInfo(self):
        print("Emp Name:",self.name)
        print("Emp age:",self.age)
        print("Emp Number:",self.eno)
        print("Emp Sal:",self.esal)
        
e = Emp("Ashok",23,"E1262",12000)
e.EmpInfo()
e.work()
e.eat_drink()
