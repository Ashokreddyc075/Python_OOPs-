Self Variable:
=============
1.Self is a reference variable,Which always pointing to the current object.With in the python class to access current object, we can use self.

class Test:
    def __init__(self):
        print(id(self))
t = Test()
print("Address of object reffered",id(t))

Therefor Both id are same.

2.The first arrgument to the constructor is always self and The first arrgunent to the instance method is always self.We are not required to provide value for the self variable,PVM itself provide value.
class Test():
    def __init__(self):
        print("constructor")
t=Test() #output is constructor

3.We can use self always with in the class only.Inside the constructor we can use self to declare object related variable.Inside instance method we can use self to access the values of instance variable.
4.Self is not a key word,we can use any name like delf/kelf etc but recommended to use self.
